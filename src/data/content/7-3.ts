  title: "Method References",
  summary:
    "Method references are shorthand for lambdas that simply delegate to an existing method. Java supports four kinds: static, instance on a particular object, instance on an arbitrary object of a type, and constructor references.",
  deepDive:
    "A method reference replaces a lambda whose body is a single method call. Instead of writing x -> System.out.println(x), you write System.out::println. The compiler infers the functional interface from context and verifies that the referenced method's signature matches the SAM.\n\nThe four kinds are: (1) Static reference -- ClassName::staticMethod, e.g., Integer::parseInt maps to Function<String, Integer>. (2) Instance on a bound receiver -- instance::method, e.g., System.out::println where 'out' is a specific PrintStream object. (3) Instance on an unbound receiver -- ClassName::instanceMethod, e.g., String::length, where the first parameter becomes the receiver: (String s) -> s.length(). (4) Constructor reference -- ClassName::new, e.g., ArrayList::new maps to Supplier<ArrayList> or Function<Integer, ArrayList> depending on which constructor is resolved.\n\nThe unbound instance reference is the trickiest to understand. When you write String::toLowerCase, the functional interface must supply the String instance as the first argument: Function<String, String> f = String::toLowerCase means f.apply(s) calls s.toLowerCase(). For two-argument methods like String::compareTo, it maps to BiFunction<String, String, Integer> where the first argument is the receiver.\n\nMethod references improve readability by eliminating boilerplate and making intent explicit. They also aid static analysis tools and IDEs in providing better navigation and refactoring support. However, use them only when they are clearer than the equivalent lambda -- complex expressions with argument reordering or partial application still require explicit lambdas.\n\nIn interviews, be prepared to convert between lambdas and method references in both directions, and explain why certain lambdas cannot be converted (e.g., when the lambda body does more than call a single method or when arguments need transformation).",

      a: "Method references become unclear when: (1) the argument order differs from what the method expects, requiring reordering, (2) you need to call the method with a fixed argument plus a variable one, like x -> obj.method(x, DEFAULT_VALUE), (3) there is ambiguity between overloaded methods causing compile errors, (4) the reference would sacrifice readability -- e.g., SomeUtility::process is opaque without context while x -> processRecord(x) is self-documenting. Also, method references cannot be used with generic methods when the compiler cannot infer type arguments from context alone.",
