  summary:
    "Reader and Writer are abstract base classes for character-oriented I/O in Java, handling text with proper character encoding. They sit on top of byte streams via InputStreamReader/OutputStreamWriter and are essential for correct text processing across different charsets.",
  deepDive:
    "While InputStream/OutputStream deal with raw bytes, Reader/Writer deal with characters (char/String) and handle encoding/decoding transparently. InputStreamReader bridges bytes to characters using a specified Charset, and OutputStreamWriter does the reverse. If no charset is specified, the system default is used, which is a common source of bugs in cross-platform applications. Since Java 18, the default charset is UTF-8 on all platforms.\n\nFileReader and FileWriter are convenience wrappers that open a file and create the appropriate bridge. However, before JDK 11 they did not allow specifying a charset (they always used the platform default). Since JDK 11, FileReader and FileWriter accept a Charset parameter. Always specify UTF-8 explicitly for portable code: new FileReader(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8). BufferedReader adds line-based reading with readLine() and an internal buffer, while BufferedWriter provides newLine() and buffered writing.\n\nPrintWriter is a common utility that provides print(), println(), and printf() methods for formatted text output. It can wrap any Writer or OutputStream and optionally auto-flush on println(). StringReader and StringWriter operate on in-memory Strings, useful for testing and text processing without file I/O.\n\nSince Java 8, BufferedReader.lines() returns a Stream<String> enabling functional-style text processing. Files.readString() (Java 11) and Files.readAllLines() (Java 7) provide even simpler one-shot reading. For large files, streaming with BufferedReader or Files.lines() is preferred over readAllLines() which loads everything into memory. Always close Readers/Writers via try-with-resources to prevent file handle leaks.",

      q: "What is the difference between InputStream and Reader?",
      a: "InputStream reads raw bytes (0-255 values), while Reader reads characters (Unicode char values) with proper encoding/decoding. Reader handles multi-byte character encodings like UTF-8 where a single character may span multiple bytes. For text data, always use Reader/Writer to avoid encoding bugs. InputStreamReader bridges the two by wrapping an InputStream with a Charset to produce characters.",

      id: "10-2-q1",
      q: "Why is specifying charset explicitly important, and what changed in Java 18?",
      a: "Before Java 18, the default charset was platform-dependent (UTF-8 on Linux/Mac, often Windows-1252 on Windows). Code using the default charset could produce different results on different platforms -- a file written on Linux might display garbled text on Windows. Always specifying StandardCharsets.UTF_8 ensures consistent behavior. Java 18 (JEP 400) changed the default charset to UTF-8 on all platforms, but explicit specification is still best practice for code that must run on older JDKs.",

      q: "Compare Files.readAllLines(), Files.lines(), and BufferedReader for processing a 10 GB log file. Which approach would you use and why?",
      a: "Files.readAllLines() loads the entire file into a List<String> in memory -- for 10 GB, this would cause OutOfMemoryError. Files.lines() returns a lazy Stream<String> backed by a BufferedReader, processing one line at a time with constant memory overhead; however, you must close the stream (try-with-resources) and it cannot easily be parallelized since file I/O is sequential. BufferedReader with a manual readLine() loop gives the most control (custom buffer sizes, progress tracking, explicit error handling per line). For a 10 GB file, Files.lines() with try-with-resources is the best balance of simplicity and memory efficiency: try (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(path)) { lines.filter(...).forEach(...); }.",
      difficulty: "senior",

  tip: "Use Files.newBufferedReader(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8) instead of manually nesting new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(...))) -- it is cleaner and handles encoding correctly.",
