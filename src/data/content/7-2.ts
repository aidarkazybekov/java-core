  title: "Lambda Expressions",
  summary:
    "Lambda expressions provide concise syntax for implementing functional interfaces, replacing verbose anonymous inner classes. They capture variables from the enclosing scope under 'effectively final' rules and enable a functional programming style in Java.",
  deepDive:
    "A lambda expression is an anonymous function that implements the single abstract method of a functional interface. The syntax is (parameters) -> expression or (parameters) -> { statements; }. Type inference usually allows omitting parameter types, and single-parameter lambdas can drop the parentheses: x -> x * 2.\n\nLambdas are NOT syntactic sugar for anonymous inner classes. The compiler generates an invokedynamic bytecode instruction that defers the creation strategy to the LambdaMetafactory at runtime. This avoids creating a separate .class file for each lambda and enables the JVM to optimize aggressively -- it may use a singleton instance for non-capturing lambdas, generate a wrapper class once, or even inline the lambda body.\n\nVariable capture follows strict rules: lambdas can reference local variables only if they are effectively final (never reassigned after initialization). Instance and static fields have no such restriction because they live on the heap. This constraint exists because the lambda may outlive the stack frame, so captured locals are copied by value -- mutation would create confusing semantics where the copy and original diverge.\n\nA common interview trap is the difference between capturing and non-capturing lambdas. A non-capturing lambda references no variables from its enclosing scope and can be reused as a singleton. A capturing lambda closes over state, so a new instance may be created each time. This distinction matters in performance-critical Stream pipelines.\n\nLambdas compose naturally with the default methods on functional interfaces (andThen, compose, and, or, negate), enabling point-free programming patterns. Combined with method references and the Stream API, lambdas transform Java from a purely object-oriented language into a multi-paradigm language capable of expressive, declarative data processing.",

      q: "What does 'effectively final' mean and why is it required for lambda variable capture?",
      a: "A variable is effectively final if it is never reassigned after initialization, even without the 'final' keyword. Lambdas require this because captured local variables are copied by value into the lambda instance. If mutation were allowed, the lambda's copy and the original could diverge, leading to confusing behavior. Instance fields are exempt because they are accessed through the 'this' reference on the heap.",

      q: "How does the JVM implement lambdas under the hood, and why is this different from anonymous inner classes?",
      a: "The compiler emits an invokedynamic instruction that calls LambdaMetafactory.metafactory() at the first invocation. This bootstrap method generates the implementation class at runtime, giving the JVM freedom to optimize -- it may create a singleton for non-capturing lambdas, generate a lightweight wrapper, or inline the body. Anonymous inner classes, in contrast, produce a separate .class file at compile time (Outer$1.class) and always allocate a new object. The invokedynamic approach avoids classloading overhead and enables better JIT optimization.",

      q: "Explain the performance implications of capturing vs non-capturing lambdas in a hot Stream pipeline, and how you would diagnose issues.",
      a: "Non-capturing lambdas (referencing no external variables) can be cached as singletons by the JVM, producing zero allocation overhead. Capturing lambdas must store references to captured variables, potentially allocating a new object per invocation. In a hot loop processing millions of elements, this allocation pressure triggers frequent minor GCs. Diagnosis involves JFR (Java Flight Recorder) allocation profiling or -XX:+PrintCompilation to check inlining. Fixes include extracting lambdas to static final fields, converting to method references on static methods, or refactoring to avoid capture by passing values as stream elements.",
