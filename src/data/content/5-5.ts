  summary:
    "Java's exception hierarchy roots at Throwable, branching into Error (JVM-level problems) and Exception (application-level issues). Understanding this tree is essential for correct catch ordering and interview discussions.",
  deepDive:
    "At the top sits java.lang.Throwable, the only type that can be thrown and caught in Java. It has two direct subclasses: Error and Exception. Error represents serious JVM-level failures: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, NoClassDefFoundError, and similar conditions. Catching an Error is almost always wrong because the JVM state may be corrupted. The one common exception to this rule is AssertionError in test frameworks.\n\nException branches into two families. Checked exceptions (IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, InterruptedException) directly extend Exception and must be declared or caught. RuntimeException and its subclasses (NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException, UnsupportedOperationException) are unchecked. The compiler does not enforce handling for RuntimeException subtypes.\n\nCatch block ordering matters because Java matches the first compatible catch from top to bottom. Putting a superclass catch before a subclass catch makes the subclass catch unreachable, causing a compilation error. This is a common interview question. For example, catching Exception before IOException won't compile. The correct pattern is to catch the most specific exception first.\n\nSome commonly confused pairs: NoClassDefFoundError (Error, thrown when a class present at compile time is missing at runtime) vs ClassNotFoundException (checked Exception, thrown by Class.forName() when a class is not found by name). Similarly, NullPointerException (unchecked, programming bug) vs IOException (checked, external failure). Understanding these distinctions shows deep knowledge of the hierarchy and when each type is appropriate.",

      q: "What is the difference between NoClassDefFoundError and ClassNotFoundException?",
      a: "NoClassDefFoundError is an Error thrown by the JVM when a class that was present at compile time cannot be found at runtime -- typically a classpath or deployment problem. ClassNotFoundException is a checked Exception thrown by methods like Class.forName() when the specified class name cannot be found via reflection. The key difference: NoClassDefFoundError means 'it was there, now it is gone' (deployment issue), while ClassNotFoundException means 'I looked for it by name and it does not exist' (dynamic loading failure).",

    {
      id: "5-5-q2",
      q: "When is it acceptable to catch Error or Throwable? What are the risks?",
      a: "Catching Throwable is acceptable only in top-level exception handlers: Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler, framework entry points, or the main method of long-running servers where you want to log the error before graceful shutdown. The risks: after an Error like OutOfMemoryError, the JVM heap may be exhausted and even logging might fail. After StackOverflowError, the thread's stack is corrupted. Catching and continuing after an Error can lead to silent data corruption, infinite restart loops, or zombie processes. If you must catch Throwable, log immediately, signal external monitoring, and typically shut down the JVM. Test frameworks catching AssertionError is the one routine exception to this rule.",

    springFeature: "Spring's DataAccessException hierarchy",
    explanation:
      "Spring provides its own rich exception hierarchy under DataAccessException with subclasses like DuplicateKeyException, EmptyResultDataAccessException, and DeadlockLoserDataAccessException. This mirrors Java's hierarchy design pattern, allowing catch blocks at different specificity levels while remaining vendor-neutral across JPA, JDBC, and other data access technologies.",
