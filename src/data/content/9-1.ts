  title: "Heap: Young, Old, Metaspace",
  summary:
    "The JVM heap is divided into Young Generation (Eden + Survivor spaces), Old Generation (Tenured), and Metaspace (off-heap class metadata). Understanding these regions is essential for diagnosing memory issues and tuning garbage collection.",
  deepDive:
    "The JVM organizes heap memory into generational regions based on the observation that most objects are short-lived. The Young Generation is where new objects are allocated and is itself split into Eden space and two Survivor spaces (S0 and S1). When Eden fills up, a minor GC copies surviving objects into one Survivor space; objects that survive multiple minor GC cycles are promoted to the Old Generation.\n\nThe Old Generation (also called Tenured) stores long-lived objects that have survived several minor collections. When the Old Generation fills up, a major (full) GC is triggered, which is significantly more expensive because it scans a larger memory area. Full GCs often cause noticeable pause times, which is why keeping promotion rates low matters in latency-sensitive applications.\n\nStarting with Java 8, the permanent generation (PermGen) was replaced by Metaspace. Metaspace stores class metadata, method bytecodes, and constant pool data in native memory rather than in the Java heap. It grows dynamically by default but can be bounded with -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize. This change eliminated the common PermGen OutOfMemoryErrors that plagued earlier JVM versions, though unbounded Metaspace growth from classloader leaks is still a risk in application servers and frameworks that perform heavy classloading.\n\nThe sizing ratio between Young and Old generation is controlled by -XX:NewRatio (default 2, meaning Old is twice the size of Young). You can also set explicit sizes with -Xmn for the Young generation. Getting these ratios right is a key part of GC tuning: a larger Young generation reduces promotion frequency but increases minor GC pause times.",

      q: "What are Eden and Survivor spaces, and why does the Young Generation have two Survivor spaces?",
      a: "Eden is where new objects are allocated. When Eden fills up, a minor GC runs and surviving objects are copied to one Survivor space (e.g., S0). On the next minor GC, live objects from both Eden and S0 are copied to S1, and S0 is cleared. The two Survivor spaces allow the GC to use a copying algorithm that avoids fragmentation, since one space is always empty and serves as the copy target.",

      q: "Why was PermGen replaced by Metaspace in Java 8, and what problems does Metaspace solve?",
      a: "PermGen had a fixed maximum size that frequently caused OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space, especially in applications with heavy classloading (app servers, OSGi). Metaspace uses native memory that grows dynamically, eliminating the fixed-size limitation. It also improves GC behavior since class metadata cleanup is tied to classloader lifecycle rather than full GC. However, you should still set -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize to prevent runaway growth from classloader leaks.",

      q: "How would you diagnose and resolve a situation where objects are being promoted to Old Generation too quickly, causing frequent full GCs?",
      a: "First, enable GC logging (-Xlog:gc* in JDK 11+) and analyze promotion rates. Check if the Young Generation is too small (-Xmn or -XX:NewRatio) causing premature promotion. Examine tenuring threshold (-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold) to see if objects are promoted before they die. Use a heap profiler to identify allocation hotspots creating unexpectedly long-lived objects. Consider increasing Survivor space ratio (-XX:SurvivorRatio) so objects have more minor GC cycles to die before promotion. In extreme cases, switching to a collector like G1 or ZGC that handles mixed collections more gracefully may help.",
