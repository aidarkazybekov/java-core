  title: "HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet",
  summary:
    "Java provides three primary Set implementations: HashSet (fastest, unordered), TreeSet (sorted via red-black tree), and LinkedHashSet (insertion-ordered). Each is backed by a corresponding Map implementation.",
  deepDive:
    "HashSet is backed by a HashMap where every element is stored as a key with a dummy constant value (PRESENT = new Object()). This means HashSet inherits all of HashMap's properties: O(1) add/remove/contains, no ordering guarantees, and dependence on proper equals/hashCode implementation. The iteration order is unpredictable and can change when the underlying map resizes.\n\nTreeSet is backed by a TreeMap, which uses a red-black tree (self-balancing BST). All operations are O(log n). Elements must be Comparable or a Comparator must be provided at construction. TreeSet maintains sorted order and provides additional navigation methods: first(), last(), headSet(), tailSet(), subSet(), ceiling(), floor(). It does not use hashCode() or equals() for comparison -- it relies solely on compareTo() or the Comparator, which means two elements are considered duplicates if compareTo returns 0, even if equals returns false.\n\nLinkedHashSet extends HashSet and maintains a doubly-linked list across all entries, preserving insertion order. It uses a LinkedHashMap internally. Operations remain O(1) like HashSet but with slightly higher overhead due to maintaining the linked list. Iteration is in insertion order and is slightly faster than HashSet because it follows the linked list rather than traversing the sparse bucket array.\n\nChoosing the right Set: use HashSet as the default (fastest), TreeSet when you need sorted iteration or range queries, and LinkedHashSet when insertion order matters (e.g., maintaining the order of items added to a shopping cart). An important gotcha: mutable objects in a HashSet can break the set's invariants if their hashCode changes after insertion, since the object will be in the wrong bucket.",

    {
      id: "6-3-q0",
      q: "How does HashSet detect duplicates internally?",
      a: "HashSet is backed by a HashMap. When you call add(element), it calls the underlying map's put(element, PRESENT). HashMap checks: (1) compute the bucket index using hashCode(), (2) if the bucket is empty, insert a new node, (3) if the bucket has entries, compare using equals(). If an existing key is found via equals(), the put returns the old value (non-null), which tells HashSet the element was a duplicate. That is why both equals() and hashCode() must be correctly overridden for custom objects.",
      difficulty: "junior",
    },
    {
      id: "6-3-q1",
      q: "What is the difference between how TreeSet and HashSet determine equality?",
      a: "HashSet uses hashCode() to find the bucket and equals() to check identity -- both methods matter. TreeSet uses compareTo() (or a Comparator) exclusively for ordering and equality. Two elements are 'equal' in a TreeSet if compareTo returns 0, even if equals() returns false. This can lead to surprising behavior: a TreeSet with a case-insensitive comparator will treat 'ABC' and 'abc' as duplicates even though equals() says they differ. This inconsistency between compareTo and equals is warned against in the Comparable contract.",
      difficulty: "mid",
    },
    {
      id: "6-3-q2",
      q: "What happens if you mutate an object after inserting it into a HashSet? How would you prevent this?",
      a: "If the mutation changes the object's hashCode(), the object becomes effectively lost in the set. It sits in a bucket determined by the old hashCode, but lookups compute the new hashCode pointing to a different bucket. contains() returns false, remove() fails, and the set can accumulate ghost entries that only show up during iteration. Prevention strategies: (1) use immutable objects as set elements (records, String, Integer), (2) if mutability is required, remove the element before mutation and re-add after, (3) use defensive copying when inserting. This is one of the most common causes of subtle bugs in production systems using HashSet or HashMap keys.",

  tip: "When asked 'which Set to use,' say: HashSet by default, TreeSet for sorted data, LinkedHashSet for insertion order. Then mention that all three are backed by their corresponding Map implementations -- this shows you understand the internal architecture.",

    explanation:
      "Spring internally uses LinkedHashSet to maintain ordered sets of bean names and active profiles, ensuring deterministic ordering. When you define multiple beans, Spring's DefaultListableBeanFactory stores bean names in a LinkedHashSet to preserve registration order, which affects autowiring when multiple candidates exist.",
