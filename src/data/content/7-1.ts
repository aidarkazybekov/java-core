  title: "Functional Interfaces",
  summary:
    "A functional interface has exactly one abstract method and serves as the target type for lambda expressions. The @FunctionalInterface annotation enforces this contract at compile time, and the java.util.function package ships dozens of ready-made interfaces.",
  deepDive:
    "A functional interface is any interface that declares exactly one abstract method (SAM -- Single Abstract Method). Default and static methods do not count toward the limit, so interfaces like Comparator (which has many defaults) still qualify. The @FunctionalInterface annotation is optional but highly recommended: the compiler will reject any interface annotated with it that has zero or more than one abstract method.\n\nThe java.util.function package introduced in Java 8 provides four foundational shapes: Function<T,R> (takes T, returns R), Predicate<T> (takes T, returns boolean), Consumer<T> (takes T, returns void), and Supplier<T> (takes nothing, returns T). Bi-variants like BiFunction, BiPredicate, and BiConsumer accept two arguments. Primitive specializations such as IntFunction, LongPredicate, and DoubleSupplier avoid autoboxing overhead on hot paths.\n\nUnaryOperator<T> extends Function<T,T> and BinaryOperator<T> extends BiFunction<T,T,T> -- both are convenience subtypes where input and output types match. Knowing the inheritance hierarchy helps you choose the most specific type, which improves readability and lets the compiler catch type errors earlier.\n\nComposition methods like Function.andThen(), Function.compose(), Predicate.and(), Predicate.or(), and Predicate.negate() enable building complex behaviors from small reusable pieces. Because these return new functional interface instances, they work naturally with immutable data pipelines and stream operations.\n\nUnderstanding functional interfaces is essential before moving to lambdas, method references, and the Stream API. In interviews, expect questions about SAM rules, why Runnable and Callable qualify, and how to design your own functional interfaces for domain-specific callbacks.",

      a: "A functional interface has exactly one abstract method (SAM). Comparator qualifies because compare() is its sole abstract method; equals() is inherited from Object and does not count, and all other methods (reversed(), thenComparing(), etc.) are default or static.",

      q: "Explain the difference between Function, UnaryOperator, and BiFunction. When would you pick each?",
      a: "Function<T,R> maps T to R with potentially different types. UnaryOperator<T> extends Function<T,T> for same-type transformations (e.g., String::toUpperCase). BiFunction<T,U,R> takes two arguments. Choose UnaryOperator when input/output types match for clarity, Function for type-changing mappings, and BiFunction when two inputs are needed such as in Map.merge() or reduce().",

      q: "How does type erasure affect functional interfaces, and what problems arise when you try to overload methods accepting different functional interface types with the same erasure?",
      a: "After erasure, Consumer<String> and Consumer<Integer> both become Consumer. If you overload process(Consumer<String>) and process(Consumer<Integer>), the compiler rejects it as a duplicate method. Workarounds include using different method names, wrapping in a custom interface with a distinct erasure, or using a single generic method with bounded types. This is why the JDK provides primitive specializations (IntConsumer, LongConsumer) rather than relying on Consumer<Integer>.",
