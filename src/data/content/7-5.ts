  summary:
    "The Collectors utility class provides factory methods for creating Collector instances that accumulate stream elements into collections, strings, maps, and statistical summaries. Custom collectors enable advanced aggregation patterns.",
  deepDive:
    "The Collector interface defines how to accumulate elements from a stream into a mutable result container. It consists of four functions: supplier (creates the container), accumulator (adds an element), combiner (merges two partial containers for parallel streams), and finisher (transforms the container into the final result). The Characteristics enum (IDENTITY_FINISH, UNORDERED, CONCURRENT) optimizes execution.\n\nCommon collectors include toList(), toSet(), toUnmodifiableList(), toMap(), joining(), groupingBy(), partitioningBy(), counting(), summingInt/Long/Double(), and summarizingInt/Long/Double(). The toMap() collector requires careful attention: if duplicate keys exist, it throws IllegalStateException unless you provide a merge function as the third argument.\n\ngroupingBy() is the stream equivalent of SQL's GROUP BY. It takes a classifier function and returns Map<K, List<T>> by default. The two-argument form accepts a downstream collector: groupingBy(Employee::getDept, averagingDouble(Employee::getSalary)) produces Map<String, Double>. Multi-level grouping chains these: groupingBy(dept, groupingBy(role)) creates nested maps.\n\nJava 12 introduced Collectors.teeing(), which applies two collectors simultaneously and merges their results. This eliminates the need for multiple passes over the data. For example, teeing(minBy(comparator), maxBy(comparator), (min, max) -> new Range(min, max)) computes both min and max in a single pass.\n\nCustom collectors are built with Collector.of(supplier, accumulator, combiner, finisher, characteristics). Understanding how to write a custom collector demonstrates deep knowledge of the Stream API and is a strong senior-level interview differentiator. The combiner function is critical for correctness in parallel streams -- it must be associative and produce the same result regardless of how the stream is partitioned.",

Supplier creates the accumulator, the accumulator function increments count and adds the value, the combiner merges two partial accumulators by adding both counts and sums, and the finisher divides sum by count.
