  title: "try / catch / finally",
  summary:
    "The try-catch-finally construct is Java's fundamental mechanism for exception handling. Understanding execution order, multi-catch blocks, and finally guarantees is critical for writing correct error-handling code.",
  deepDive:
    "The try block contains code that might throw exceptions. One or more catch blocks follow, each handling a specific exception type. Java matches the first compatible catch block from top to bottom, so more specific exceptions must come before broader ones or the code won't compile. Since Java 7, multi-catch syntax (catch (IOException | SQLException e)) lets you handle multiple unrelated exception types in a single block, reducing code duplication.\n\nThe finally block executes regardless of whether an exception was thrown, caught, or even if a return statement was encountered in try or catch. This makes it ideal for cleanup operations like closing resources. However, if both the try block and finally block contain return statements, the finally return value wins -- a common interview gotcha. Similarly, if finally throws an exception, it suppresses the original exception from try.\n\nA subtle point: if System.exit() is called inside the try or catch block, the finally block will NOT execute. Also, if the JVM crashes or the thread is killed, finally is not guaranteed. These edge cases distinguish strong candidates in interviews.\n\nBest practices include: never use empty catch blocks (at minimum log the exception), avoid catching Exception or Throwable unless at the top-level handler, prefer specific exception types, and let exceptions propagate when the current layer cannot meaningfully handle them.",

      a: "The finally block executes in almost all cases -- whether the try succeeds, an exception is caught, or even if a return statement is in the try/catch. The only cases where finally does NOT execute are: System.exit() is called, the JVM crashes, or the thread running the try block is killed or interrupted in a way that prevents execution.",

      id: "5-2-q1",
      q: "If both try and finally contain return statements, which value is returned? What about exceptions?",
      a: "The finally block's return value wins, overriding whatever try returned. This is because finally executes after try but before the method actually returns to its caller. Similarly, if finally throws an exception, it suppresses (replaces) any exception from the try block. This is why returning from finally or throwing in finally is considered bad practice -- it silently hides the original result or error.",

      id: "5-2-q2",
      q: "How does the multi-catch block work internally, and what restriction does the compiler impose on the caught exception variable?",
      a: "Multi-catch (catch (A | B e)) generates a single catch handler in bytecode that matches either exception type, avoiding code duplication. The critical restriction is that the exception variable 'e' is effectively final -- you cannot reassign it inside the multi-catch block. This is because the variable's static type is the least common supertype of the listed exceptions, and reassignment could violate type safety. Also, the listed types cannot have a subtype relationship; catch (IOException | FileNotFoundException e) won't compile because FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException.",
