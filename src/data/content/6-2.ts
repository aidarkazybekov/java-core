  summary:
    "HashMap is the most frequently asked collection in Java interviews. It uses an array of buckets with hash-based indexing, handles collisions via linked lists that convert to red-black trees at threshold 8, and rehashes when the load factor (0.75) is exceeded.",
  deepDive:
    "HashMap stores entries in a Node<K,V>[] table (array of buckets). When you call put(key, value), it computes the bucket index as (n - 1) & hash(key), where n is the array length (always a power of 2) and hash() applies a spread function that XORs the upper 16 bits with the lower 16 bits of hashCode() to reduce collisions. If two keys map to the same bucket, they form a linked list (separate chaining).\n\nSince Java 8, when a bucket's linked list reaches 8 nodes (TREEIFY_THRESHOLD), it converts to a balanced red-black tree, improving worst-case lookup from O(n) to O(log n). When the tree shrinks below 6 nodes (UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD), it converts back to a linked list. Treeification only occurs if the table has at least 64 buckets (MIN_TREEIFY_CAPACITY); otherwise, the table is resized instead. This is a critical interview detail.\n\nResizing (rehashing) occurs when size exceeds capacity * loadFactor (default 0.75). The new capacity doubles, and every entry is redistributed. In Java 8+, rehashing is optimized: since capacity is always a power of 2, each entry either stays in the same bucket or moves to bucket (old index + old capacity), determined by a single bit check. This avoids recalculating all hashes.\n\nThe contract between equals() and hashCode() is fundamental: if two objects are equal via equals(), they MUST have the same hashCode(). Violating this contract causes HashMap to place equal keys in different buckets, making lookups fail silently. HashMap is not thread-safe; concurrent modification can cause infinite loops (in old Java versions) or corrupted data. Use ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety.",

        // How put() works internally:
        // 1. hash = spread(key.hashCode()) -- XOR upper/lower 16 bits
        // 2. index = (capacity - 1) & hash
        // 3. If bucket empty: insert new Node

      q: "How does HashMap determine which bucket to place an entry in?",
      a: "HashMap computes a hash by taking the key's hashCode() and XORing its upper 16 bits with its lower 16 bits (spread function) to reduce collisions. The bucket index is calculated as (capacity - 1) & hash, which works because capacity is always a power of 2. This is a fast bitwise AND that replaces the modulo operation.",

      q: "What happens when a HashMap bucket has too many collisions? What are the thresholds?",
      a: "When a bucket's linked list reaches 8 nodes (TREEIFY_THRESHOLD), HashMap converts the list into a red-black tree, improving worst-case lookup from O(n) to O(log n). However, treeification only occurs if the table capacity is at least 64 (MIN_TREEIFY_CAPACITY); otherwise, it resizes the table instead. When removals shrink a tree below 6 nodes (UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD), it converts back to a linked list. The gap between 8 and 6 prevents thrashing between list and tree forms.",

      id: "6-2-q2",
      q: "Explain the Java 8 resize optimization for HashMap. Why must capacity be a power of 2?",
      a: "Power-of-2 capacity enables the bitwise AND trick: index = (capacity - 1) & hash, which is faster than modulo. During resize (doubling), each entry's new position depends on a single bit: the bit at the position of the old capacity. If that bit is 0, the entry stays at the same index; if 1, it moves to oldIndex + oldCapacity. This allows splitting each bucket into two using simple bit checks without recalculating hashes. Entries are split into 'lo' and 'hi' lists, maintaining order. This optimization, introduced in Java 8, also eliminated the possibility of infinite loops during concurrent resize that plagued Java 7's head-insertion rehashing.",

Understanding HashMap performance characteristics helps explain why bean lookup is O(1) and why poorly implemented hashCode() in custom beans used as map keys can degrade application performance.",
