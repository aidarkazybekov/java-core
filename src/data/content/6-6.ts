  title: "Wildcards (? extends / ? super)",
  summary:
    "Wildcard types enable flexible APIs with bounded generics. The PECS principle (Producer Extends, Consumer Super) governs when to use each. Mastering wildcards is the key to understanding Java's generic collections at a senior level.",
  deepDive:
    "Java generics are invariant: List<Dog> is NOT a subtype of List<Animal>, even though Dog extends Animal. This is because if it were, you could add a Cat to a List<Dog> through a List<Animal> reference, breaking type safety. Wildcards provide controlled variance.\n\n? extends T (upper-bounded wildcard) means 'some unknown type that is T or a subtype of T'. You can read T from such a collection but cannot add to it (except null), because the compiler doesn't know the actual type. This makes the collection a producer of T values. Example: List<? extends Number> could be List<Integer>, List<Double>, etc. You can call Number n = list.get(0) safely, but list.add(someInteger) won't compile because the list might actually be a List<Double>.\n\n? super T (lower-bounded wildcard) means 'some unknown type that is T or a supertype of T'. You can add T (and its subtypes) to such a collection but can only read Object from it, because the compiler only knows the lower bound. This makes the collection a consumer of T values. Example: List<? super Integer> could be List<Integer>, List<Number>, or List<Object>. You can safely add any Integer, but get() returns Object.\n\nThe PECS principle (Joshua Bloch, Effective Java): Producer Extends, Consumer Super. If a parameter provides data to your method, use extends. If it receives data from your method, use super. Collections.copy(List<? super T> dest, List<? extends T> src) is the textbook example: src produces elements (extends), dest consumes them (super). Unbounded wildcard <?> is equivalent to <? extends Object> and is used when you only need Object operations or don't care about the type at all.\n\nCapture helpers: sometimes the compiler cannot infer the wildcard's actual type. A private helper method with a named type parameter <T> can 'capture' the wildcard, enabling operations that wildcards alone cannot express. This pattern is common in library code.",

      q: "What does PECS stand for and what does it mean?",
      a: "PECS stands for Producer Extends, Consumer Super. If a generic collection produces (provides) elements for your code to read, use <? extends T> -- you can safely read T from it. If a collection consumes (accepts) elements your code writes into it, use <? super T> -- you can safely add T to it. For example, in Collections.copy(dest, src), src is a producer (extends) and dest is a consumer (super). This principle guides all wildcard usage in API design.",

    {
      id: "6-6-q1",
      q: "Why can't you add elements to a List<? extends Number>?",
      a: "Because the compiler doesn't know the actual type. List<? extends Number> could be List<Integer>, List<Double>, or List<Number>. If the actual type is List<Double> and you add an Integer, you break type safety. The compiler prevents all additions (except null) because it cannot verify type compatibility at compile time. Conversely, reading is safe because any element is guaranteed to be at least a Number. This is the fundamental trade-off: extends enables reading but prohibits writing.",

      id: "6-6-q2",
      q: "Explain wildcard capture and when you need a capture helper method. What compiler error indicates you need one?",
      a: "Wildcard capture is when the compiler assigns a concrete (but unknown) type to a wildcard. The error 'capture of ?' occurs when you try to use a wildcard in a context requiring a specific type -- e.g., List<?>.set(0, list.get(1)). The compiler treats ? in get and ? in set as potentially different types. A capture helper with a named parameter <T> captures the wildcard into T: private <T> void helper(List<T> list) { list.set(0, list.get(1)); }. Now both operations use the same T. The public method calls the helper, and the compiler infers T from the wildcard. This pattern appears in Collections.swap(), Collections.fill(), and many library methods.",

  tip: "Memorize PECS and the Collections.copy signature: copy(List<? super T> dest, List<? extends T> src). If an interviewer asks about wildcards, this single example perfectly demonstrates both extends and super in one method.",

    explanation:
      "Spring Data's CrudRepository<T, ID> uses bounded generics extensively. Methods like <S extends T> S save(S entity) use extends bounds to accept entity subclasses. Event listeners use ApplicationEvent<? extends BaseEvent> wildcards. Understanding PECS helps explain why Spring APIs are designed with specific wildcard bounds.",
