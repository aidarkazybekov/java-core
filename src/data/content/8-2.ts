  title: "synchronized & volatile",
  summary:
    "The synchronized keyword provides mutual exclusion and memory visibility through intrinsic locks. The volatile keyword guarantees visibility of writes across threads without mutual exclusion. Understanding when to use each is critical for writing correct concurrent code.",
  deepDive:
    "The synchronized keyword acquires an intrinsic lock (monitor) on an object. Synchronized methods lock 'this' (instance methods) or the Class object (static methods). Synchronized blocks lock an explicitly specified object. Only one thread can hold a given monitor at a time, providing mutual exclusion. When a thread exits a synchronized block, all writes made inside it become visible to any thread that subsequently acquires the same lock -- this is the monitor lock rule of the Java Memory Model.\n\nThe volatile keyword guarantees two things: (1) Visibility -- a write to a volatile variable is immediately visible to all threads. Without volatile, a thread may cache a field value in a CPU register or L1 cache and never see updates from other threads. (2) Ordering -- reads/writes to volatile variables cannot be reordered by the compiler or CPU with respect to other memory operations. Volatile establishes a happens-before relationship: a write to a volatile variable happens-before every subsequent read of that variable.\n\nThe critical difference: synchronized provides both atomicity AND visibility, while volatile provides only visibility. The classic example is a counter: volatile int count paired with count++ is NOT thread-safe because ++ is a read-modify-write operation (three steps). You need synchronized or AtomicInteger for atomic compound operations. However, volatile is perfect for flags (volatile boolean running = true) that are only written by one thread and read by others.\n\nDouble-checked locking for lazy singleton initialization requires volatile: without it, the JVM can reorder the assignment and constructor, allowing another thread to see a partially constructed object. The pattern is: if (instance == null) { synchronized(lock) { if (instance == null) { instance = new Singleton(); } } } where instance must be volatile.\n\nSynchronized has performance implications: uncontended lock acquisition is very fast (biased locking, thin locks), but contended locks cause threads to park and context-switch. Lock coarsening and lock elision are JIT optimizations that reduce overhead. Volatile reads/writes insert memory barriers but avoid the context-switch cost of locks, making them cheaper for simple visibility scenarios.",

      q: "Why is volatile required in double-checked locking for singleton initialization?",
      a: "Without volatile, the JVM can reorder the steps of object creation. The statement instance = new Singleton() involves: (1) allocate memory, (2) invoke constructor, (3) assign reference. Reordering may execute step 3 before step 2, so another thread sees a non-null reference to a partially constructed object and returns it from getInstance(). Declaring instance as volatile inserts memory barriers that prevent this reordering, ensuring the constructor completes before the reference is published.",

      q: "Explain the JIT optimizations for synchronized (biased locking, thin locks, lock coarsening, lock elision) and how they affect performance decisions.",
      a: "Biased locking (deprecated in JDK 15, removed in 18) allowed a lock to be 'biased' toward the first thread that acquires it, making re-acquisition nearly free. Thin locks use a CAS on the object header for uncontended acquisition, avoiding OS-level mutexes. If contention is detected, the lock inflates to a heavyweight monitor with OS thread parking. Lock coarsening merges adjacent synchronized blocks on the same lock into one, reducing lock/unlock overhead. Lock elision removes locks entirely when escape analysis proves the locked object is thread-local. These optimizations mean uncontended synchronized is very fast (nanoseconds), so premature optimization by avoiding synchronized is usually unjustified. Profile before replacing synchronized with lock-free algorithms.",
