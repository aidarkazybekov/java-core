  summary:
    "ReentrantLock provides explicit locking with features beyond synchronized: try-lock with timeout, interruptible locking, fair ordering, and Condition objects for fine-grained thread coordination. It implements the Lock interface from java.util.concurrent.locks.",
  deepDive:
    "ReentrantLock is an explicit lock that offers the same mutual exclusion as synchronized but with additional capabilities. 'Reentrant' means the same thread can acquire the lock multiple times without deadlocking -- a hold count tracks nesting, and the lock is released only when the count drops to zero. This matches synchronized's reentrancy behavior.\n\nKey advantages over synchronized: (1) tryLock() attempts to acquire without blocking, returning false if unavailable -- essential for avoiding deadlocks. (2) tryLock(timeout, unit) waits for a limited time. (3) lockInterruptibly() allows a waiting thread to be interrupted, which synchronized cannot do (a thread BLOCKED on a monitor ignores interrupts). (4) Fair locking: new ReentrantLock(true) grants the lock in FIFO order, preventing starvation at the cost of throughput. (5) Multiple Condition objects via newCondition(), enabling separate wait-sets (e.g., notEmpty and notFull for a bounded buffer).\n\nThe try-finally pattern is mandatory: lock.lock(); try { // critical section } finally { lock.unlock(); }. Failure to unlock in a finally block causes permanent lock leakage. This is the primary maintenance risk compared to synchronized, which automatically releases the lock on block exit or exception.\n\nReadWriteLock (ReentrantReadWriteLock) separates read and write access: multiple readers can acquire the read lock concurrently, but the write lock is exclusive. This dramatically improves throughput for read-heavy workloads. Java 8 added StampedLock, which supports an optimistic read mode -- tryOptimisticRead() returns a stamp without acquiring the lock, and validate(stamp) checks if a write occurred. If no write happened, the read avoided all locking overhead.\n\nIn interviews, be prepared to discuss when ReentrantLock is preferred over synchronized (need for tryLock, fairness, interruptibility, multiple conditions) and when synchronized is sufficient (simpler syntax, no risk of forgetting unlock, adequate for most use cases). Virtual threads (Project Loom) work better with ReentrantLock than synchronized because synchronized can pin virtual threads to carrier threads.",

ReentrantLock allows multiple Condition objects: e.g., notFull and notEmpty for a bounded buffer. Producers await on notFull and signal notEmpty; consumers do the opposite. This avoids waking threads that cannot make progress, reducing unnecessary context switches. Each Condition also supports awaitNanos(), awaitUntil(), and awaitUninterruptibly() for more control.",

      a: "ReentrantReadWriteLock allows concurrent reads but exclusive writes. Under heavy read contention, writers can starve. StampedLock adds an optimistic read mode: tryOptimisticRead() returns a stamp without acquiring any lock. After reading shared state, validate(stamp) checks if a write occurred. If valid, the read succeeded with zero locking overhead. If invalid, fall back to a pessimistic read lock. StampedLock outperforms RRWL in scenarios with very frequent reads and rare writes (e.g., a price feed). Caveats: StampedLock is not reentrant (recursive locking deadlocks), not condition-aware (no newCondition()), and the optimistic pattern is error-prone -- developers must remember to validate and retry. It should be used only when profiling shows RRWL read-lock contention is a bottleneck.",

  tip: "Always use the try-finally pattern with ReentrantLock: lock() before try, unlock() in finally. Forgetting finally means an exception permanently leaks the lock, and no other thread can ever acquire it.",
