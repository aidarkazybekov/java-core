  title: "ArrayList vs LinkedList",
  summary:
    "ArrayList and LinkedList are the two primary List implementations in Java. ArrayList is backed by a dynamic array offering O(1) random access, while LinkedList is a doubly-linked list with O(1) insertions at the ends. In practice, ArrayList wins in almost all scenarios due to CPU cache locality.",
  deepDive:
    "ArrayList internally uses an Object[] array. When the array is full, it grows by 50% (newCapacity = oldCapacity + oldCapacity >> 1), copying all elements to a new array via Arrays.copyOf. Random access via get(index) is O(1) since it's a direct array index. Adding at the end is amortized O(1), but inserting or removing in the middle is O(n) because all subsequent elements must be shifted. The default initial capacity is 10.\n\nLinkedList implements both List and Deque. Each element is a Node with prev, item, and next references. Insertion and removal at either end are O(1), but get(index) is O(n) because traversal from head or tail is required. The linked structure also means each element incurs overhead for two pointers (16 extra bytes on 64-bit JVM per node), and nodes are scattered in heap memory.\n\nThe critical practical insight that impresses interviewers: LinkedList is almost never the right choice. Modern CPUs rely heavily on cache prefetching, which works with contiguous memory (ArrayList's array) but fails with pointer-chasing (LinkedList's nodes). Benchmarks consistently show ArrayList outperforming LinkedList even for mid-list insertions until list sizes become very large. Joshua Bloch, the author of LinkedList, has said he almost never uses it.\n\nWhen to actually use LinkedList: when you need a Deque (double-ended queue) and don't need random access, or when you're iterating with a ListIterator and performing many insertions/removals during iteration. For stack or queue behavior, consider ArrayDeque instead, which is also backed by an array and outperforms LinkedList for those use cases as well.",

      q: "What are the time complexities for get(), add(), and remove() in ArrayList vs LinkedList?",
      a: "ArrayList: get() is O(1), add() at end is amortized O(1), add()/remove() in middle is O(n) due to shifting. LinkedList: get() is O(n) because it must traverse, add()/remove() at head or tail is O(1), but add()/remove() by index is O(n) because finding the position requires traversal. The key nuance: even though LinkedList removal is O(1) once you have the node, finding that node is O(n).",

      id: "6-1-q1",
      q: "Why is ArrayList generally preferred over LinkedList even for frequent insertions?",
      a: "CPU cache locality. ArrayList stores elements in contiguous memory, enabling efficient CPU cache prefetching -- sequential memory access is orders of magnitude faster than random access. LinkedList nodes are scattered across the heap, causing constant cache misses during traversal. Additionally, each LinkedList node requires ~32 bytes of overhead (object header + two pointers), significantly increasing memory usage. Benchmarks show ArrayList outperforms LinkedList for most operations including mid-list insertion until very large sizes, because the cost of shifting a contiguous array is hidden by hardware optimizations.",

    {
      id: "6-1-q2",
      q: "How does ArrayList grow internally, and how would you optimize for a known large dataset?",
      a: "When the internal array is full, ArrayList creates a new array of size oldCapacity + (oldCapacity >> 1) -- a 50% increase. It then copies all elements via System.arraycopy() (a native, highly optimized memcpy). For known sizes, pass the capacity to the constructor: new ArrayList<>(1_000_000). This avoids multiple resize-and-copy operations. Without preallocation, growing from 10 to 1M elements requires approximately 30 resizes, each involving a full array copy. Also consider using trimToSize() after bulk loading to reclaim unused capacity. For primitive types, prefer specialized collections (Eclipse Collections IntArrayList or arrays) to avoid boxing overhead.",

  tip: "In interviews, confidently say 'ArrayList is the default choice for List, and ArrayDeque for stack/queue. LinkedList has almost no practical advantage due to cache locality.' This shows real-world understanding.",

    explanation:
      "Spring Data JPA methods returning List<Entity> use ArrayList internally. When a repository method returns a List, the JPA provider (Hibernate) populates an ArrayList from the ResultSet. Understanding ArrayList's growth behavior matters when fetching large datasets -- consider pagination with Pageable to avoid loading millions of rows into a single ArrayList.",
